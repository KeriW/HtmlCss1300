<h3>My Favorite Band: Tame Impala</h3>
	<p> My favorite band is Tame Impala, a psychedelic indie rock band from Australia. Formed in 2007,
	the band has seen several members come and go. The current lineup consists of:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Kevin Parker - <em>Lead Singer</em></li>
		<li>Dominic Simper - <em>Guitar</em></li>
		<li>Cam Avery - <em>Bass</em></li>
		<li>Jay Watson - <em>Keyboard</em></li>
		<li>Julien Barbagallo - <em>Drums</em></li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Album Reviews</h4>
	<dl>
		<dt>Innerspeaker, 2010</dt>
			<dd>
				Tame Impala's first studio release introduced the world to their retro psychedelic sound. Recorded in a dilapidated house overlooking the Indian Ocean,<br>
				it has a distinctly less polished feel than later releases. Poplular tracks include <em>Lucidity</em> and <em>Solitude is Bliss</em>
			</dd>
		<dt>Lonerism, 2012</dt>
			<dd>
				Tame Impala's follow-up album has a much tighter theme than their first release, with lyrics and subjects focused on loneliness and isolation.<br> Musically,
				however, the album remains energetic and dynamic. Top tracks include <em>Feels Like We Only Go Backwards</em> and <em>Elephant</em>.
			</dd>
		<dt>Currents, 2015</dt>
			<dd>
				Tame Impala's best album to date features a more communal and upbeat sound than any of their other work so far. <br>This is an album that can be played on a
				summer drive or at a party with friends, and was their first album to reach #1 on the Australian charts. This album features my two favorite Tame Impala songs,
				<em>The Less I Know The Better</em> and <em>Cause I'm a Man</em>.
